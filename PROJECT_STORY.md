### Phase 2: Multi-Task Expansion (Weeks 3-4)
Expanded to support five core prediction tasks:

```
DTI (Drug-Target Interaction) → DTA (Drug-Target Affinity) → 
DDI (Drug-Drug Interaction) → ADMET Properties → Molecular Similarity
```

**Technical implementation:**
- Created unified model manager for handling 20+ transformer models
- Implemented task-specific validation and preprocessing
- Added real-time visualization with Plotly

### Phase 3: AI Agent Integration (Weeks 5-6)
